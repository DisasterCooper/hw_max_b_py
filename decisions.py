# 1. LF will be replaced by CRLF in git

# Git can handle this by auto-converting CRLF line endings into LF when you add a file to the index,
# and vice versa when it checks out code onto your filesystem. You can turn on this functionality
# with the core.autocrlf setting. If you’re on a Windows machine,
# set it to true – this converts LF endings into CRLF when you check out code:

# answer = git config --global core.autocrlf true
# добавить в powershell команду
